ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm a game developer based in New York City, currently working on a hero shooter with a small team.

## What I'm Working On
- ðŸŽ® Developing a fun, TF2, OW, and Rivals inspired hero shooter with unique mechanics and diverse characters

## About Me
I bring a passion for tight gameplay mechanics and character-driven design to my work. When I'm not coding or designing game systems, you can find me analyzing competitive games or testing new gameplay concepts.
